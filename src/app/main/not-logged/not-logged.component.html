    <h2>vision</h2>

    <p>It should be incredibly easy to start doing what you really care
      about. Fulltime.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Connect with people who share your passions.</li>
      <li>Share your ideas and improve them together.</li>
      <li>Solve challenges we all face.</li>
      <li>Start or join a project that will make the difference.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Currently we develop this platform to do exactly that.</p>

    <p>One day we'll have a network of places where people can meet and
      collaborate. We'll learn from mistakes and discover the best practices.</p>
    <p>We'll support each other. We will empower ourselves to leave the
      corporations, institutions and other meaningless systems we can't
      escape now.</p>
